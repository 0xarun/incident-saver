// Minimal: we don't strictly need to inject for selection since chrome.contextMenus gives selectionText.
// But include helper to allow future extension (like auto-detecting Outlook side column date clicks)


// Content script currently does nothing but is present for future expansion.


// Example helper: if user clicks a date element, we could optionally copy it to the clipboard
